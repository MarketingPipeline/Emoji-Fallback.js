# Emoji-Fallback.js
Provide fallback support for devices that don't support have full emoji support


## What this does 
Some older device's do not have emoji support and some emojis are shown as text character's like this <code>☺</code> or not all. This script provides a fallback by checking if there is emoji support on device - if NOT emoji's are replaced with images. 

**Example**

<code>☺</code> will become ☺ on devices with no emoji support
