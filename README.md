# Emoji-Fallback.js
Provide fallback support for devices that don't support Emoji's


## What this does 
Some older device do not have emoji support and some emoji's are shown as text character's like this <code>☺</code> or not all. This script provides a fallback by checking if no emoji support on device - emoji's are replaced with images. 

**Example**

<code>☺</code> will become ☺ on devices with no emoji support
